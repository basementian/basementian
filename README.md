> Building in the dark. Shipping in daylight.  

I'm a founder, full-stack builder, and infrastructure hoarder.  
Everything I create is scrappy, synergistic, and designed to outlast the hype.


### 🧱 Current Stack

🧩 **Ecosystem Building**  
I’m building a vertically integrated commerce system:  
→ eco-packaging, bike delivery, guerrilla ads, micro-warehousing, 3PL, subscription boxes, and more.  
Everything talks to everything else.

🤖 **AI R&D**  
I’m pivoting into AI infrastructure:  
→ multi-agent routing (Aliam), auto social managers (TrendLoop), labeling ops, and whatever else makes money and scales.

🧰 **Tools I Use**  
- Languages: `JavaScript` `Python` `SQL` `Bash`
- Frontend: `React` `Tailwind` `Vite`
- Backend: `Node.js` `Express` `Firebase` `SQLite`
- Infra: `Docker` `GitHub Actions` `VPS` `Linux`
- AI: `OpenAI` `Langchain` `Whisper` `Transformers`
